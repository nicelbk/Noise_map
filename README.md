# Rose Gardening Search Tool

This repository provides a simple Python script that helps you look up cultivation methods and images for different types of roses using [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/).

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- A valid SerpApi API key

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script and provide your SerpApi key when prompted:

```bash
python rose_gardening.py
```

Select the type of rose from the list. The script will search Google for cultivation instructions and display the first result along with URLs for four related images, which also open in your default browser.
